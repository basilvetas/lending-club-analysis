# Utilities Folder

All the heavy code for modeling, inference or criticism is stored in this folder. Part of the code that we used is based on the latest development version of [TensorFlow Probability](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/tree/master/tensorflow_probability/python), in our subfolder *tf*. This code is under the same open source license as TensorFlow, and we changed many parts to let it run on the current version of Edward.
