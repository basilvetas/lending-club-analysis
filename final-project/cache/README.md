# Cache Folder

Cached dataframes and models are stored in this folder. All the functions used in the final notebook automatically check if there is a cached version of the results stored in that folder, for reproducibility purposed. By using these pretrained results, one can have direct access to all of our results and the corresponding TensorFlow session to sample, get statistics, etc.
