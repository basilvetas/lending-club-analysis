    "The domain of our project is peer-to-peer consumer lending. Our goal is to model credit risk on personal loans, more precisely to evaluate the probability of default or delinquency of borrowers during their loan period.\n",

    "LendingClub loans are made over either a 36 or 60 month term, with a variety of statistics reported about each unique loan on a monthly basis (our analysis focuses on the 36 month terms). Our variable of interest is called `loan_status` which has eight possible states. We attempt to model credit risk by estimating the probability of a loan transitioning between any two of these states at any month during the loan term. Below are the eight `loan_status` states, with descriptions from LendingClub's [website](https://help.lendingclub.com/hc/en-us/articles/215488038-What-do-the-different-Note-statuses-mean-):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Issued**: New loan that has passed all LendingClub reviews, received full funding, and has been issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current**: Loan is up to date on all outstanding payments. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **In Grace Period**: Loan payment is late, but within the 15-day grace period.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Late (16-30)**: Loan is late, past the grace period, hasn't been current for 16 to 30 days.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Late (31-120)**: Loan has not been current for 31 to 120 days.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Charged Off**: Loan for which there is no longer a reasonable expectation of further payments. Charge Off typically occurs when a loan is 120 days or more past due and there is no reasonable expectation of sufficient payment to prevent the charge off. Loans for which borrowers have filed for bankruptcy may be charged off earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default**: Loan has not been current for an extended period of time. Charged off and default states are similar, yet different. [TODO explain]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fully paid**: Loan has been fully repaid, either at the expiration of the 3- or 5-year year term or as a result of a prepayment.\n",

    "To model the transition states month over month, we employed a stationary discrete time step Markov Chain model. Discrete because our data is on a monthly basis, and stationary because we assume the probability distribution of  transition is independent of time (we use the same model across all month). Recall the Markov property, or the \"memoryless\" assumption, that for some sequence of events, that the conditional probability of the next time step $x_t$ depends only upon the previous time step $x_{t-1}$, ignoring all time steps that preceded it:\n",

    "Our dataset consists of approximately 40 million observations from loans spanning between 2007 through Q3 2018. The dataset includes dozens of fields, however for our Markov model (and to simplify data management) we only need to work with 4 features: `id`, `loan_status`, `term`, and `age_of_loan`. During preprocessing, we also filtered out all loans with a 60 month term and 36 term loans that extended beyond 36 months, reducing our dataset to around 27 million observations. In total, we have just under 1.5 million unique loans, which can be seen in the rows column after we split and pivot our data below."
