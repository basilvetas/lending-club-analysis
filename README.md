# Final Project Instructions

The focus of this course is the final project. The goal is for you to choose a real world problem and to loop through the probabilistic modeling cycle using probabilistic programming. You will be expected to write, document, and report your analysis and findings. This will involve a significant amount of programming. Based on the number of students taking the course for credit, you will work either in groups of two or three. I will provide some suggestions; however, you are encouraged to find a problem in a field that excites you.

You will produce an 8-page final report and present your findings to the class in a short presentation at the end of the term. This project will measure your cumulative understanding of the material while providing you with a supportive environment to try out your new skills. Each student within a group will receive an individual grade, corresponding to their involvement in the project. [Source] (http://www.proditus.com/syllabus2018.html)
